# XeroDay's API Sniffer

API Sniffer is a GitHub-focused secret discovery toolkit for scanning public repositories and identifying exposed API keys, tokens, webhooks, and other sensitive credentials. It is part of the X3r0Day Framework and is built for security research, defensive analysis, and responsible disclosure.

The project is organized around discovery, scanning, and querying, with an AI-first launcher, a workflow orchestrator, shared routing/search utilities, and a live scanner dashboard.

---

## How It Works

API Sniffer supports two operating modes:

1. **AI workflow orchestration** via `AIWorkflow.py`, where natural-language requests are routed into discovery, scanning, direct database querying, or chained workflows.
2. **Manual execution** via `main.py`, which exposes a control center for running each stage or the full pipeline.

The core pipeline is:

**Stage 1 - Discovery (`APISniffer.py`)**: Queries GitHub for newly created public repositories across a recent time window, deduplicates them against the live queue and prior scan history, and stores fresh targets in `recent_repos.json`.

**Stage 2 - Scanning (`APIScanner.py`)**: Pulls repositories from the queue, resolves the repo's default branch when needed, downloads repository archives, scans matching files, optionally scans recent commit patches, and writes results into `leaked_keys.json`, `clean_repos.json`, or `failed_repos.json`.

**Stage 3 - AI Search (`AISearch.py`)**: Queries the local findings database with natural language. The search runtime is shared with the AI workflow, so database questions like `show all the API keys` can be answered directly from the launcher flow.

## Components

- **`APISniffer.py` (Discovery)**
  - Queries GitHub search for newly created public repos.
  - Uses a time-windowed, chunked search with adaptive splitting for high-volume windows.
  - Deduplicates against historical outputs and the live queue.
  - Supports proxy fallback via `live_proxies.txt` when direct requests fail or rate-limit.

- **`APIScanner.py` (Scanner)**
  - Pulls targets from `recent_repos.json` and scans repository archives.
  - Filters by file extension and filename to reduce noise.
  - Optionally scans recent commit history (patches) to catch secrets removed after commit.
  - Provides a live Rich-based dashboard with queue stats, thread status, and recent leaks.
  - Supports interactive repo injection during runtime (AI-assisted or regex-based).

- **`AISearch.py` + `shared/ai_search_runtime.py` (AI Query Engine)**
  - Uses Groq's OpenAI-compatible API to interpret natural-language queries.
  - Plans category/term filters, searches `leaked_keys.json`, and returns results.
  - Supports summary mode (counts and top categories) and full search results.

- **Shared Utilities (`src/shared/`)**
  - `ai_client.py`: Groq API calls and key handling (`GROQ_API_KEY`).
  - `ai_policy.py`: Loads policy from `config/ai_policy.json` and supports overrides.
  - `ai_search_runtime.py`: Query planning, filtering, and result rendering.
  - `api_signatures.py` + `signature_loader.py`: Data-driven signature loading from `data/signatures.json`.
  - `category_routing.py`: Maps user queries to signature categories.
  - `scanner_matcher.py`: Regex matching + normalization (e.g., Firebase URL expansion).
  - `scanner_targets.py`: Repo target extraction (regex + AI assist).
  - `scanner_dashboard.py`: Live scanner dashboard layout.

The following files are generated at runtime and are not part of the source code:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `recent_repos.json` | Queue of discovered repositories waiting to be scanned |
| `leaked_keys.json` | Database of detected secrets |
| `clean_repos.json` | Repositories that were scanned with no findings |
| `failed_repos.json` | Repositories that failed to download or parse |

Optional local input file:

- `live_proxies.txt` - User-managed proxy list in `ip:port` format

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- The packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Unified Launcher (Recommended)

```bash
python main.py
```

This opens the launcher. From there:

- Press `Enter` to launch the AI workflow directly OR,
- Type `Manual` to open the numbered control center OR,
- Type `help` to see how the workflow works

Example requests:

- `show all the API keys`
- `find any Discord tokens`
- `start scanning`
- `run discovery for last 3 minutes, then scan`

### AI Workflow Orchestrator

```bash
python src/AIWorkflow.py
```

This prompts for a natural-language request, routes it using `config/ai_policy.json`, and runs the required stages in sequence. It uses Groq's OpenAI-compatible API (default model is configured in `config/ai_policy.json`).

### Stage 1: Discover Repositories

```bash
python src/APISniffer.py
```

CLI flags:

```text
--lookback-mins
--chunk-mins
--pages-to-scrape
--proxy-retry-limit
```

Discovery queries GitHub for recently created repositories and writes fresh entries to `recent_repos.json`. It skips repositories already present in `clean_repos.json`, `failed_repos.json`, or `leaked_keys.json`. If your IP gets rate-limited, it can fall back to proxies from `live_proxies.txt`.

### Stage 2: Scan for Leaked Secrets

```bash
python src/APIScanner.py
```

CLI flags:

```text
--max-threads
--history-depth
--scan-heroku-keys
--no-commit-history
--prefer-proxy
```

The scanner reads from `recent_repos.json`, resolves the repository's default branch when possible, downloads each repository as a ZIP archive, and scans it against the supported secret signatures. It can also inspect recent commit patches. Results are written to `leaked_keys.json`, `clean_repos.json`, or `failed_repos.json`. Scanned repositories are removed from the queue.

**Scanner controls:**
- `Space`: Pause/resume scanning
- `i`: Enter AI-assisted repo insertion mode
- `Esc`: Cancel repo insertion input

### Stage 3: Query the Database

```bash
python src/AISearch.py
```

One-shot query:

```bash
python src/AISearch.py --query "Show all AWS keys"
```

---

## Proxy Configuration

All network-facing scripts support HTTP proxy rotation. Create a file named `live_proxies.txt` in the working directory with one proxy per line:

```text
103.21.244.0:8080
45.77.56.114:3128
192.168.1.100:8888
```

Proxies are used as a fallback when direct GitHub requests are rate-limited or blocked.

---

## Supported API Key Signatures

Signature rules are data-driven and loaded from `data/signatures.json`. You can add or update patterns there and they will be picked up automatically.

Examples of supported categories include:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| AI and LLM Providers | OpenAI (legacy/project), Anthropic, Groq, xAI (Grok), OpenRouter, HuggingFace, Replicate, Cerebras |
| Cloud and Infrastructure | AWS Access Keys, AWS Session Tokens, DigitalOcean, Google API/GCP, Heroku, Databricks |
| Source Control | GitHub classic PATs, GitHub fine-grained PATs, GitLab PATs |
| Package Registries | NPM, PyPI |
| Communication and Webhooks | Discord bot tokens, Discord webhooks, Slack bot/user tokens, Slack webhooks, Telegram |
| Payments and Commerce | Stripe, Square, Shopify |
| Email and Messaging | SendGrid, Mailgun, Twilio |
| Database and Backend Services | Supabase, Firebase, PlanetScale, Airtable, Appwrite, Deta, PocketBase |
| Other Utilities | Postman, Mapbox, Sentry |

---

## Configuration

- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Required for AI workflow routing and AI search. If not set, the tools will prompt for it.
- `AI_POLICY_PATH`: Optional. Overrides the default policy path (`config/ai_policy.json`).

**`config/ai_policy.json`**
- Defines the Groq API endpoint, model name, and temperature settings.
- Controls workflow routing rules and the AI query planner behavior.

**`data/signatures.json`**
- Contains all signature definitions (name + regex + tags).
- Heroku rules are tagged `heroku` and can be included with `--scan-heroku-keys`.
