# XeroDay's API Sniffer

API Sniffer is a GitHub-focused secret discovery toolkit for scanning public repositories and identifying exposed API keys, tokens, webhooks, and other sensitive credentials. It is part of the X3r0Day Framework and is built for security research, defensive analysis, and responsible disclosure.

The project is organized around discovery, scanning, and querying, with an AI-first launcher, a workflow orchestrator, shared routing and search utilities, scanner dashboard helpers, repo-target extraction helpers, and a small test suite for scanner behavior.

---

## How It Works

API Sniffer supports two operating modes:

1. **AI-first launch path** through `main.py` -> `AIWorkflow.py`, where natural-language requests are routed into discovery, scanning, direct database querying, or chained workflows.
2. **Manual stage execution** where you run the modules yourself or use the numbered launcher menu.

The core pipeline is:

**Stage 1 - Discovery (`APISniffer.py`)**: Queries GitHub for newly created public repositories across a recent time window, deduplicates them against the live queue and prior scan history, and stores fresh targets in `recent_repos.json`.

**Stage 2 - Scanning (`APIScanner.py`)**: Pulls repositories from the queue, resolves the repo's default branch when needed, downloads repository archives, scans matching files, optionally scans recent commit patches, and writes results into `leaked_keys.json`, `clean_repos.json`, or `failed_repos.json`.

**Stage 3 - AI Search (`AISearch.py`)**: Queries the local findings database with natural language. The search runtime is shared with the AI workflow, so database questions like `show all the API keys` can be answered directly from the launcher flow.

**Shared runtime modules (`src/shared/`)**: Hold reusable logic for API signature definitions, category routing, AI-assisted search, scanner matching, scanner dashboard rendering, and GitHub repo target extraction.

```

The following files are generated at runtime and are not part of the source code:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `recent_repos.json` | Queue of discovered repositories waiting to be scanned |
| `leaked_keys.json` | Database of detected secrets |
| `clean_repos.json` | Repositories that were scanned with no findings |
| `failed_repos.json` | Repositories that failed to download or parse |

Optional local input file:

- `live_proxies.txt` - User-managed proxy list in `ip:port` format

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- The packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Execution Order

The modules can run one by one, and the launcher provides the fastest path through the full workflow.

### Unified Launcher (Recommended)

```bash
python main.py
```

This opens the launcher. From there:

- Press `Enter` to open the AI workflow directly
- Type `help` to see how the workflow works
- Type `Manual` to open the numbered control center

Example requests:

- `show all the API keys`
- `find any Discord tokens`
- `start scanning`
- `run discovery for 3 minutes, then scan`

### Stage 1: Discover Repositories

```bash
python src/APISniffer.py
```

This queries GitHub for recently created repositories and writes fresh entries to `recent_repos.json`. Discovery also skips repositories that already exist in the queue or in the historical output files (`clean_repos.json`, `failed_repos.json`, and `leaked_keys.json`). If your IP gets rate-limited, it can fall back to proxies from `live_proxies.txt`.

### Stage 2: Scan for Leaked Secrets

```bash
python src/APIScanner.py
```

This reads from `recent_repos.json`, resolves the repository's default branch when possible, downloads each repository as a ZIP archive, and scans it against the supported secret signatures. It can also inspect recent commit patches. Results are written to `leaked_keys.json`, `clean_repos.json`, or `failed_repos.json`. Scanned repositories are removed from the queue.

The scanner opens a full-screen terminal dashboard.

- Press `Space` to pause or resume
- Press `i` to insert GitHub repo targets while the scanner is running
- Repo insertion accepts GitHub URLs or `owner/repo` targets and pushes them into the live queue

### Stage 3: Query the Database

```bash
python src/AISearch.py
```

This opens the AI search prompt for the local database. It requires a Groq API key, which can be set through `GROQ_API_KEY` or entered at runtime.

You can also run a one-shot query without opening the interactive prompt:

```bash
python src/AISearch.py --query "Show all AWS keys"
```

Example queries:

- `Show me all AWS keys`
- `Find any Discord tokens`
- `List all AI-related API keys`

## Proxy Configuration

All network-facing scripts support HTTP proxy rotation. Create a file named `live_proxies.txt` in the working directory with one proxy per line:

```text
103.21.244.0:8080
45.77.56.114:3128
192.168.1.100:8888
```

Proxies are used as a fallback when direct GitHub requests are rate-limited or blocked.
